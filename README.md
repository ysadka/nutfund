##Nutfund Team to-do

Hey guys, Justin here. I'm thniking, for now at least, that we can use this as a landing page for next steps.

It's all open for interpertation, but here is what I see as the next logical iteration:

* finish work for users to create their own nutfund

* add messaging for email updates

* add social sharing and shortcode integration to each page for social spread

* create dashboard where we can review and approve submitted nutfunds

If you have any other things you think we need to get done please put your name down and add to the list. :)
